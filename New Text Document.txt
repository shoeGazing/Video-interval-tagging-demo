1.overview--where has been tagged
-when tagged, a virtual notebook to show to indicate the time and notes

2.show the moment tag--hide other tags
-avoid visual clutters

5.literature(normal and edu videos),sw available

-- how to select the interval/annotation styles(image/text...)/specific annotation(text,icons...)

1. panel-notes(questions/summary) and effective labels --time-based

2. show the temporary annotation and fade the other ones(panel) as playback/show or hide the mark on the video frame in every frame/show the marks on the seek bar and label and hide others as playback

--physical mark on the video frame may be useful for math, engineering courses
--instant or interval mark on the seek bar can be useful for asking more general questions such as SciInq students
(get the info from page6)

3. video authoring sw, manual selecting the interval and adjust it by one frame/ increase the interval by 5seconds and adjust it by one frame

4. 

5.comparison with CLAS/ DBR(design-based research)
